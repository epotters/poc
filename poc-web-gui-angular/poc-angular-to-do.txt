TO DO

Possibility to create entities from the entity selector when the entity is not available. Start with text types, create a link directly, maybe use a popup editor

Fix required validation for related entities, to actually require an entity, not just text in the input field

Add readonly view to list and editor, turning the last one into a detail view

Create a common baseclass for inline and full EntityEditor

Add unit and e2e tests (using Karma, Protractor)

Split off the entity and auth libraries to their own projects
Maybe add Angular Schematics to create a basic implementation for an entity type from the cli

Small improvement: Sorting should not hide the editor when editing a new entity

Sorting by related entities does not work right


To consider: Maybe just send the id of related entities instead of the whole entity by changing the value option of the autocompletes

Add error styling (red) to validation error tooltips

Figure out another way to pass constants to the EntityMaterialModule (not sure this is still a problem)

Bug: Redirect to returnUrl after (re)authentication (often) does not work when using lazy module loading

Add a table variety of the autocomplete
    Example: https://github.com/OasisDigital/angular-material-search-select

Add animations to the entity library, to start with animating showing, hiding and moving editor and filter row

Clean up the top icons for Editor and Filter. Add possibility to hide it or move it to a menu. Add control icons for show, hide and clear filter and editor

Add CardView with paginator to Editor and Detail View


Add User Roles
Add User Groups
Add User Settings

Add Detail View and plumbing to switch to it
Add State to all components (View, Edit, Search)
Swithch to the right state based upon role
Make a clean separation between read only browsing and editing.


Enable searching for compound display names like the full name for a person (now only searches for the last name). Requires backend changes.
Enable searching for years, months and ranges in Date fields


Implement a selection model for the list

Implement batch updates and deletes (either currently found entities or selection)

Decide whether to use the EntityManager as the main entrypoint per entity

To consider: Make all entity components imolement a common interface with some methods like show and hide

To consider: Add displayName to entities (interface Identifiable?, add interface Displayable?)...

Fix error when sending oidc post message to iframe on startup

Material Theme for Keycloak: same styling as the rest of the application, add the styling to the project

Decide what to do with the sidenav, it is no being used right now
Fix the links to experimental features in the sidenav: manager, list of cards

Refactoring: Move the Configuration Service to core

Bug: Reloading the page makes the App Component load three times

Create a matching Angular Material layout for the Keycloak login screens

Move this list to GitLab


DONE

Loading... smaller. Replaced by yin-yang spinner
Styling: search fields without space for a label
Bug: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError in employments
Feature: Show the menu in outline on the startup screen
Remove person list styling from EntityListComponent
Show lists and editors in dialogs
Backend: Search for non-strings, dates and enums
Add autocompletes to the editor row.
Styling search fields to the same height as table rows
Overlay a table row with an editor
Bug: Error deleting an organization that has related people. Probably vise versa also.
Bug: autocomplete shows options using displayname instead of the function
Replace the list plus field in related entity component with an EntityListComponent so more fields can be shown
Make EntityListComponent configurable so that columns, visibility of header, paginator, editor and filter are configurable from outside the component
sortable, pageable, filterable, editable
Bug: stopEditing returns nothing in some cases
Remove n-grid
Bug: Fix the displayed date format in date fields... again
Full Editor: disable and grayout uneditable fields, most notably the id fields
Bug: When saving an entity from a list showing only a few fields, the fields that are not included are cleared. They should be left untouched.
Bug: Textareas in th inline editor are displayed too large. Use inputs here with proper cutting off content
Inline row editor: only save if the form is dirty when pressing enter
Bug: Expression changed error in the beginning when loading an entity list

Bug: Make the autocompletes in the inline-editor lazy loading. Now they load also when there is no need.

Externalize configuration so it can be changed without rebuilding (WIP). Fix error 404 on startup
