Show validation errors on or next to the fields

Add dirty check to the editor Show an unsaved changes dialog


Make batch delete work (frontend and backend)

Look into further separating the confirmation process from the API processes

Fix or remove organizations for now


Fix flicker when moving to next or previous person (only load the data, do not reload the outlet)
